# Input and Output Redirection in Linux
In Linux, input/output (I/O) redirection allows you to control where the
standard input, output, and error streams of a command or program are directed.
This enables you to manipulate the flow of data and perform various tasks effieciently. The standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr) are represented by file descripters:
- stdin (file descriptor 0)
- stdout (file descriptor 1)
- stderr (file descriptor 2

# 8. Creating Secure Files and Directories
<ol>
	<li> Create a new file named **secure_file.txt** with sensitive information </li>
	<li> Set the permissions of **secure_file.txt** to give read and write permissions to the owner only using octal notation </li>
	<li> Use the **umask** command to set a restrictive default permission for newly created files in your home directory (e.g 077) </li>
	<li> Create a new directory name **secure_dir** </li>
	<li> Set the permissions of **secure_dir** to give read, write, and execute permissions to the owner only using octal notation </li>
	<li> Verify the permissions of both the file and the directory using **ls -l** </li>
	<li> Test creating new files and directories within your home directory to see if the default permissions are applied correctly </li>

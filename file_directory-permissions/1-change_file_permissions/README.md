### Exercise 1: Changing File Permissions
<ol>
	<li> Create a new text file named "sample.txt" </li>
	<li> Check the current permissions of the file using 'ls -l' </li>
	<li> Change the permissions of the file to give read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, read, and write permissions to the group, and only read permissions to others using octal notation. </li>
	<li> Verify the new permissions using 'ls -l'. </li>
	<li> Test accessing, modifying, and executing the file with different user accounts to see if the permissions are applied correctly </li>
</ol>
